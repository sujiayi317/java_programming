/**
 * This program demonstrates inheritance.
 * Manager is a subclass of Employee
 *
 * The fact that an object variable (such as the variable e) can refer to multiple actual types is called
 * "polymorphism". Automatically selecting the appropriate method at runtime is called "dynamic binding".
 *
 * Object variables are polymorphic. A variable of type Employee
 * can refer to an object of type Employee or to an object of any subclass of the Employee class
 * (such as Manager, Executive, Secretary, and so on).
